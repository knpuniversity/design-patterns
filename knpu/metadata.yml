title: Design Patterns from Space!
summary: |
    We all know that building an app where spaceships battle each other
    is geek-awesomeness. But what about building that app *and*
    learning the most powerful programming **design patterns** that exist!?
    We should totally do that!

    Design patterns are much more than just scholarly topics: they
    are tried-and-true solutions to problems that *we* developers
    face every single day. We'll show you the best ones, by actually
    *coding* them and seeing how they help:

    * Most problems already have a solution: a design pattern!
    * You learn how and why lessons learned by other developers who have encountered the same problems and survived to the trip.
    * They are called "Gang of Four", abbreviated GoF and their are gods in Design Patterns.
    * You will be a Master. Learn what past masters learned
    * You know the foundations with [oo](https://knpuniversity.com/tracks/oo), now learn the POWER of implementation about Design Patterns.
    * Discuss with you're co-beerer about design problem knowing the names of Design Patterns.
    * It is probably the most important things to know to be a good developer
    * Play with Patterns.

    But in fact !?
    What is a Design Pattern?

    The best definition that could be given is obviously one of the Gang of Four.

    Christopher Alexander, an inspiration for many pattern enthusiasts:
    “Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in
    our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in
    such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever
    doing it the same way twice”

    And so we ~~learn~~ play in case study in a significant great application… Battleship of Space of course !
