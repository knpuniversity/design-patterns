title: Design Patterns in Space!
summary: |
    It's time to learn Design Patterns!
    Besides, your life will depend on your understanding of Design Patterns.
    We'll show you how each design pattern are presented and their application.

    But in fact !?
    What is a Design Pattern?

    The best definition that could be given is obviously one of the Gang of Four.

    Christopher Alexander, an inspiration for many pattern enthusiasts:
    “Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in
    our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in
    such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever
    doing it the same way twice”

    * Most of the problem we face has already been resolved.
    * You learn how and why lessons learned by other developers who have encountered the same problems and survived to the trip.
    * They are called "Gang of Four", abbreviated GoF and their are gods in Design Patterns.
    * You will be a Master. Learn what past masters learned
    * You know the foundations with [oo](https://knpuniversity.com/tracks/oo), now learn the POWER of implementation about Design Patterns.
    * Discuss with you're co-beerer about design problem knowing the names of Design Patterns.
    * It is probably the most important things to know to be a good developer
    * Play with Patterns.

    And so we ~~learn~~ play in case study in a significant great application… Battleship of Space of course !
