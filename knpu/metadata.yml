title: Design Patterns from Space!
summary: |
    We all know that building an app where spaceships battle each other
    is geek-awesomeness. But what about building that app *and*
    learning the most powerful programming **design patterns** of all time!?
    We should totally do that!

    Design patterns are much more than just scholarly topics: they
    are time-tested solutions to problems that *we* developers
    face every single day. We'll show you the best ones, by actually
    *coding* them and seeing how they help:

    * Most problems already have a solution: a design pattern!
    * Creational Patterns: Abstract Factory, Singleton, Builder, etc
    * Structural Patterns: Adapters, Bridges, Decorators & proxies!
    * Behavioral Patterns: Commands, Iterators, Visitors, Observers, etc
    * Delicious Patterns: Ice cream, cookies, pizza & donuts (not provided by the tutorial)
    
    Finally sound super hipster when talking with other programmers ("Did you see how I used the Flyweight pattern?").
    Oh, and take your [Object-Oriented](http://knpuniversity.com/screencast/oo) skills
    to a pro level.
